<p>Still, with a lot option readily available, and with a lot lingo surrounding the subject of office telephones, it can be hard to understand where to start. While Digital Phone Systems are practical and convenient; they're not mobile. However, if your business should abide by security policies that require data to be stored on-site, then a hosted solution is probably not the best option. The only distinction in between Centrex and today's hosted phone systems (besides the lower expense these days's hosted systems) is that the Centrex systems ran over the traditional phone networks (the conventional phone lines) instead of the Internet (as is the case with a hosted VoIP system today).</p>
