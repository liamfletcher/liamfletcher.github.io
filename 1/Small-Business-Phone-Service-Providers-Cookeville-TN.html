<p>Still, with so much choice readily available, and with so much jargon surrounding the topic of office telephones, it can be hard to know where to start. While Digital Phone Systems are convenient and useful; they're not mobile. However, if your business should comply with security policies that require data to be saved on-site, then a hosted solution is most likely not the best solution. The only difference between Centrex and today's hosted phone systems (besides the lower cost these days's hosted systems) is that the Centrex systems ran over the standard phone networks (the standard phone lines) instead of the Internet (as holds true with a hosted VoIP system today).</p>
<p>There are several well known PBX producers that use extremely regarded phone systems, one being the Avaya IP Office.
